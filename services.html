  <h3>The Story</h3>
  <p>
  On each project, Reid sets out to take the best photographs possible, working hard to make all shoots as close to that perfect vision as possible.<br/>
  In doing so Datsuns-R-Us has obtained a worldwide following on social media with more than 1.25 million fans on his verified Facebook page to date.<br/><br/>
  </p>
  <h3>The Cars</h3>
  <p>
  For Reid the cars are about showing the beauty of every datsun but with a custom flare that matches the owners personality. Growing up Reid had always seen modified and classic Datsuns and admired their raw beauty and it wasn't until summer of 2012 when he was able to take a 1976 Datsun 260Z for a spin that he truely fell in love and started the search for his very own. Now having found one he wants to capture and share the beauty of his own and others Datsuns.
